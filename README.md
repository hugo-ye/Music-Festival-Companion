## 4. API Integration

### Ticketmaster Discovery API
The project utilizes the Ticketmaster Discovery API, an interface that provides access to a global inventory of live events.

This API enables the application to search and retrieve real-time data for concerts, sports games, arts, and theater productions. By leveraging this external service, the application can offer users up-to-date schedules, venue details, and ticketing information from all over the world.
